# Auto Defect Capture in NextGen QE

The **Analyze** tab in **NextGen QE** is responsible for automatically capturing **defects** that occur during test suite execution.  
This feature helps in identifying and logging issues without manual intervention, improving testing efficiency and traceability.

---

## How Auto Defect Works

When you execute any **Test Suite**, NextGen QE can automatically detect and log failed test cases as **defects**.  
These defects are then available for review and tracking under the **Analyze** section.

## Enabling Auto Defect

You can enable Auto Defect in two ways:

1. **From the User Run Configuration**  
   Learn about setting up configurations under  
   👉 [User-run-config](/web-testing/user-run-config#⚙️-web-run-config-in-nextgen-qe)

2. **From the Orchestrate Tab (Run Config Section)**  
   Navigate to:  
   👉 [Orchestrate-run-config](/web-testing/orchestrate/run-config)

---

## Steps to Enable Auto Defect

1. Go to **NextGen QE → Orchestrate → Run Config**  
2. Select your **Test Suite Run Configuration**  
3. Mark **Yes** for the option **“Auto Defects”**  
4. Save your configuration

> 💡 **Tip:** Once Auto Defect is enabled, any test case failure during execution will automatically generate a defect entry under the **Analyze** tab for quick debugging and tracking.
