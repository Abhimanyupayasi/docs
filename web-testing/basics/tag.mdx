# Tag Locator

The Tag locator selects elements by HTML tag, such as div, input, button, etc. Itâ€™s best combined with context to avoid broad matches.

```html
<button type="submit">Sign in</button>
```

Example usage

- Target: tag=button
- Behavior: Selects all <code>button</code> elements; refine with parent/attributes if needed.

<Note>
Tag alone can match many elements. Pair with filters (e.g., text or attributes) for precision.
</Note>
