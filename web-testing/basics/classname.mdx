# Class Name Locator

The Class Name locator selects elements by the value of their class attribute.

```html
<div class="alert success">Saved</div>
```

Example usage

- Target: class=alert
- Behavior: Matches elements containing the class "alert" (including multi-class strings).

<Caution>
Class names are often reused across components. Combine with other selectors if matches are too broad.
</Caution>
