## Fundamentals at a Glance

### <Icon icon="globe" size={20} /> What is Web Testing
Web testing ensures web applications work correctly across browsers, devices, and environments.  
It validates UI, functionality, performance, and compatibility to deliver a seamless user experience.

---

### <Icon icon="shield-check" size={20} /> Why It Matters
Web testing improves **user experience**, detects issues early, and ensures every release remains secure and reliable across platforms.

---

### <Icon icon="gauge" size={20} /> Automation Testing
Automation testing executes test cases using tools or frameworks instead of manual effort — improving **speed, coverage,** and **accuracy**.

---

### <Icon icon="user-check" size={20} /> Manual Testing
Manual testing is performed by human testers following defined steps.  
It’s best for exploratory, usability, and ad-hoc testing where intuition and observation are critical.

---

### <Icon icon="boxes" size={20} /> Low-Code Testing
Low-code testing allows test creation and execution using visual workflows and reusable components — requiring little or no programming knowledge.

---

### <Icon icon="rocket" size={20} /> NexGen QE Approach
NexGen QE introduces a **low-code automation framework** built on reusable objects, keywords, and intelligent execution — streamlining complex testing scenarios.

---

### <Icon icon="key" size={20} /> Keyword-Based Testing
Keyword-based testing structures automation around defined actions such as  
`Click`, `mouseHover`, and `Wait` — making test steps readable and maintainable.

  </Card>
  <Card title="Tag" href="/web-testing/basics/tag" icon="tags">
    Select elements using HTML tags like <code>div</code> or <code>button</code>.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Class Name" href="/web-testing/basics/classname" icon="hashtag">
    Target elements using their <code>class</code> attribute.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Name" href="/web-testing/basics/name" icon="badge">
    Locate elements using the <code>name</code> attribute.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Text" href="/web-testing/basics/text" icon="text-width">
    Match elements based on visible text content.
