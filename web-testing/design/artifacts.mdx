# <i class="fa-solid fa-box-archive" style={{color:'#3b82f6'}}></i> Artifacts Management

This is the section where we manage all **files, images, and media** that will be used in  
**test steps**, **test suites**, and **test processes** inside **NextGen QE**.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info" style={{color:'#0ea5e9'}}></i> What is an Artifact?

Artifacts act as a central storage area for reusable files and assets.  
You can store items such as:

- 📁 Images  
- 📊 Excel Sheets  
- 📄 PDFs  
- 🎥 Media or reference files  

These artifacts can be referenced inside test data or directly in test steps.

> Example: Upload a sample Excel sheet used for login credentials, or an image used for validation.

### Step 4: Create a New Artifact
Click **Create New Artifact**, then:
- Enter the **artifact name**
- **Upload** the file (image, Excel, or media)

---

### Step 5: Copy File Path
After creating the artifact, you’ll see a **file path**.  
Copy this — you’ll use it later in your test data or test steps.

---

### Step 6: Use File Path in Test Data
Go to the **Test Data** section and paste the artifact path as a value.  
This links your uploaded file to your test data set.

---

### Step 7: Use Artifacts in Test Steps
Once the artifact is linked through test data, you can use it in your test steps with keywords such as:

- `upload file`
- `open uploaded excel`
- `use uploaded media`

---

✅ **Done!**
You’ve successfully created and linked an artifact in **NextGen QE**.  
You can now reuse the same artifact across different test cases and suites.

> 💡 **Tip:** Keep file names meaningful, like `UserLoginData.xlsx` or `BannerImage.png`, for easy reference.
