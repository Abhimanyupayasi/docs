## üß† Key Responsibilities of the Design Tab

### 1. Create Test Scripts under Features & Functionalities
Design tab allows you to **create test scripts** grouped by features or functionalities.  
You can define multiple scenarios, steps, and validations to ensure full coverage.  
‚û°Ô∏è Learn how to create detailed test cases in **[Writing Test Cases](/web-testing/writing-tests)**.

---

### 2. Manage Test Data
Easily create, update, and organize test data for various automation needs.  
You can attach data directly to test scripts or share it across multiple tests.  
‚û°Ô∏è Explore more in **[Test Data Management](/web-testing/test-data)**.

---

### 3. Define and Reuse RTS (Reusable Test Scripts)
Build **Reusable Test Scripts (RTS)** that can be integrated across different test suites ‚Äî improving maintainability and reducing effort.  
‚û°Ô∏è Learn about RTS setup in **[Reusable Test Scripts](/web-testing/design/rts)**.

---

### 4. Create Custom Scripts and Execute Test Cases
Extend the power of NexGen QE by writing **custom scripts** that handle advanced logic, API calls, or third-party integrations.  
You can run your test cases using these custom scripts for complete flexibility.  
‚û°Ô∏è Learn more in **[Custom Scripts](/web-testing/design/custom-scripts)**.

---

### 5. Manage Artifacts
The Design tab also provides **Artifact Management**, allowing you to store, version, and reuse automation assets such as data files, scripts, and configurations.  
It ensures that all test components are traceable and accessible for future runs.  
‚û°Ô∏è Learn more in **[Artifacts Management](/web-testing/design/artifacts)**.
