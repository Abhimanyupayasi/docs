# Testing Strategy in NexGen QE
NexGen QE offers a robust framework to implement various testing strategies that ensure comprehensive software quality. This section delves into the key testing strategies supported by NexGen QE, helping you choose the right approach for your projects.

## Core Testing Strategies
### 1. Functional Testing (FT)
Validates that the software functions according to specified requirements. NexGen QE allows you to create detailed functional test cases that cover all user scenarios.

### 2. Regression Testing (RT)
Ensures that new code changes do not adversely affect existing functionalities. With NexGen QE, you can easily automate regression test suites to maintain software stability.

### 3. Adaptive Functional Testing (AFT)
Focuses on dynamically adjusting test cases based on changes in the application. NexGen QE supports AFT by allowing you to create flexible test scenarios that can evolve with your application.

### Other Testing Strategies
Read more about various testing strategies including Accessibility Testing, API Testing, and more in the [Testing Types](/web-testing/testing-types) section.
