# Execute in NextGen QE

The **Execute** tab in **NextGen QE** is where all test executions take place — from **Test Suites** and **Processes** to **Use Cases** and **Schedulers**.  
It enables manual and automated execution flows to ensure complete test coverage.

---

## Overview

The Execute tab allows you to:

1. Run **Feature**, **Product**, **Module**, and **Release** level test suites  
2. Execute **Processes** containing grouped test suites  
3. Execute **Use Cases** for end-to-end validation  
4. Schedule automatic executions via **Schedulers**
