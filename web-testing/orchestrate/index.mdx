# Orchestrate in NextGen QE

The **Orchestrate** tab is the central section of **NextGen QE** that brings everything together — your **Design**, **Strategy**, and **Configurations** — into a unified testing workflow.

Before using the Orchestrate tab effectively, it’s important to understand how other sections contribute to the overall testing lifecycle.

## Step 1: Understand the Design Tab Capabilities

To use the Orchestrate tab efficiently, you first need to understand the capabilities of the **Design** tab, where foundational testing components are created.

Refer to the following documentation pages to get familiar with each area:

- [Test Data Management →](/web-testing/testdata)  
  Learn how to create and manage reusable test data across your projects.

- [Reusable Test Steps (RTS) →](/web-testing/design/rts)  
  Understand how to create reusable functional test steps for consistency and efficiency.

- [Artifacts →](/web-testing/design/artifacts)  
  Explore how to manage files, media, and assets used throughout your tests.

> **Note:** The **Design** tab acts as the foundation — all reusable and sharable testing components are created here.

## Step 2: Configure Your Testing Strategy

Next, explore the **Strategy** tab — this is where you define *what kind of testing* will be executed and at *which level*.

In the Strategy tab, you can:
- Choose the **testing type** (Functional, Regression, Smoke, or Sanity)  
- Associate testing with **Release**, **Product**, or **Module** levels  
- Plan execution flows and control dependencies between components  

> The **Strategy** tab ensures that your tests are aligned with product goals and release cycles.

## Step 3: Configure Your QE User Settings

Before you begin orchestration, understand how **User Configurations** affect runtime behavior.  
These are managed within the **QE User Config** section.

Refer to the following pages for configuration details:

- [Web Run Config →](/web-testing/user-run-config)  
  Configure browser types, environments, and web-specific run settings.

- [User Variable →](/web-testing/user-run-config)  
  Define global or user-level variables that can be reused across multiple tests.

## Step 4: Bringing It All Together with Orchestrate

Once you have a clear understanding of **Design**, **Strategy**, and **QE User Config**, you can start working in **Orchestrate**.  
This is where all your test components and configurations come together into executable workflows.

Within the Orchestrate tab, you can:
- Combine test cases and strategies into a unified execution flow  
- Assign environments, schedules, and configurations  
- Automate end-to-end test execution
