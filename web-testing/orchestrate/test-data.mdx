# Suite-Level Test Data Management

The **Test Suite level** in **NextGen QE** provides centralized control for creating and managing test data that can be reused across multiple test cases within the same suite.  
This ensures consistency, reduces redundancy, and streamlines test execution across related test cases.

If you’re new to Test Data concepts, refer to the main guide here:  
[Understanding Test Data Management →](/web-testing/test-data)

## Overview

Suite-level test data allows generation of reusable records based on predefined **column names**, **data types**, and **test field mappings**.  
Data can be generated, previewed, updated, or deleted before submission, and once finalized, it’s stored centrally for reuse across all test cases in the suite.

## Key Capabilities

1. **Centralized Data Generation** — Generate test data directly at the suite level for unified use across multiple test cases.  
2. **Column-Based Data Creation** — Data generation is enabled only when suite-level column definitions exist.  
3. **Test Case-Based Mapping** — Generate records based on test case mappings and associated data fields.  
4. **Data Preview and Validation** — Review generated data before final submission.  
5. **Update/Delete Operations** — Modify or remove records before submission for better control.  
6. **Central Storage** — All approved data is stored centrally and automatically synchronized across the linked test cases.

## Example Workflow

1. Navigate to the **Orchestrate → Test Suite** section.  
2. Open the **Test Data Management** popup for your suite.  
3. Define or verify column names and data types.  
4. Click the **Generate** icon to create test data records.  
5. Preview, validate, and confirm data generation.  
6. Save or update the data for centralized reuse.

## Result

With suite-level test data, teams can maintain consistent, reusable datasets across test cases while minimizing duplication and manual effort.  
All generated data remains synchronized at the suite level, ensuring accuracy during execution.
