# Creating and Managing Test Suites in Orchestrate

The **Orchestrate** section allows you to create and manage **feature-level test suites**.  
Test suites combine validated test cases under specific testing types and features, enabling structured and automated test execution.

## Prerequisites

Before creating a test suite, ensure that:
1. A **Testing Type** has been created in the [Strategy Tab](/web-testing/strategy-tab).  
   If you havenâ€™t configured this yet, please review that documentation first.

## Steps to Create a Test Suite

### Step 1: Navigate to the Orchestrate Tab

Go to the **Orchestrate** tab from the main navigation.



---

### Step 2: Select or Open a Feature
