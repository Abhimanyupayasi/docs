# Test Suites Creation in NextGen QE

In **NextGen QE**, test suites can be created at multiple hierarchy levels — **Product**, **Module**, and **Release** — to support scalable and structured test execution.  
This approach ensures alignment between testing coverage and the product’s delivery lifecycle.

---

## Overview

Higher-level test suites group related test cases for broader validation and release readiness.  
They enable centralized management of tests tied to specific product modules or versions, improving traceability and reuse.

---

## Creating a Test Suite

Test suite creation at Product, Module, or Release level follows the same process used for feature-level suites.

Refer to:  
[Feature-Level Test Suite Creation →](/web-testing/orchestrate/feature-level-test-suite)

---

### Step 1: Open the Orchestrate Tab

Access the **Orchestrate** tab from the main navigation panel.

### Step 3: Define Test Suite Details

Click **Create Test Suite**, then specify required details such as:

- **Test Suite Name**  
- **Testing Type**  
- **Platform**  
- **Run Mode**  
- **Description**

Once completed, save the configuration.

## Outcome

The test suite is now created under the selected hierarchy level.  
Validated test cases can be linked to it and executed through the **Execute** tab.

For details on execution, see:  
[Executing Test Suites →](/web-testing/execute/executing-test-suites)
