# Creating a Suite Under a Flow

In **NextGen QE**, you can organize test execution using flows within the **Orchestrate** module.  
Each flow allows you to group related test suites and attach validated test cases for structured execution.

---

## Steps to Create a Suite Under a Use Case Flow

### Step 1: Open the Orchestrate Tab and Navigate to Use Case
Navigate to the **Orchestrate** tab from the main navigation menu.

### Step 4: Attach Validated Test Cases
After the suite is created, attach the **validated test cases** to the suite.  
Only verified and approved test cases can be linked to maintain consistency and traceability.

## Result

The suite is now successfully created under the selected flow, with validated test cases linked for execution.  
You can proceed to execute the flow from the **Execute** module.
