# Testing Types

NexGen QE supports a wide range of testing types to ensure end-to-end software quality.  
Each testing type focuses on specific aspects of functionality, performance, usability, and compliance.

## ðŸ§  Recommended Testing Types by NexGen QE Team

To achieve optimal automation coverage and maintain quality at scale, the NexGen QE team recommends starting with the following core testing approaches:

### 1. Functional Testing (FT)
Validates software against defined functional requirements, new product features, or user stories to ensure correct behavior and expected outcomes.

### 2. Regression Testing (RT)
Ensures that new code changes do not negatively impact existing features.  
Commonly used during iterative releases or CI/CD pipelines to maintain overall stability.

### 3. Adaptive Functional Testing (AFT)
Uses AI-driven analytics to adjust test strategies dynamically based on real-time system behavior and evolving requirements.  
Optimizes efficiency and reduces maintenance effort across large-scale projects.

## ðŸ§© Other Testing Types

### Accessibility Testing (ACT)
Ensures software is usable by people with disabilities, following standards like WCAG and Section 508.

---

### API Testing (API)
Verifies the functionality, reliability, and security of APIs â€” including endpoint validation and response accuracy.

---

### Browser Compatibility Testing (BCT)
Ensures consistent performance and UI behavior across different browsers, browser versions, and operating systems (Windows, macOS, Android, iOS).

---

### Beta Testing (BT)
Conducted in real-world environments by selected end users before release to validate readiness and user experience.

---

### Conformance Testing (CFT)
Validates adherence to technical standards and specifications (W3C, IEEE, ISO).

---

### Compliance Testing (CMT)
Ensures alignment with external laws, regulations, and industry frameworks such as ISO 27001, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and SOX.

---

### Compatibility Testing (CT)
Checks that the application performs correctly across devices, configurations, and platforms.

---

### Installation Testing (INT)
Verifies proper installation and uninstallation, including configuration validation post-setup.

---

### Integration Testing (IT)
Ensures seamless communication and data flow between integrated modules or services.

---

### Responsiveness Testing (RS)
Validates adaptive design and layout across multiple devices and resolutions to maintain usability.

---

### Smoke Testing (SMT)
Performs quick checks on core functionalities to determine system readiness for deeper testing.

---

### Sanity Testing (SNT)
Focuses on verifying specific areas after fixes or minor changes to confirm they work as intended.

---

### System Testing (ST)
Evaluates the entire systemâ€™s functionality as a whole to confirm integrated operations.

---

### User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
Ensures that the system meets business objectives and user expectations prior to deployment.

---

### Usability Testing (UST)
Examines interface intuitiveness and overall user experience for clarity and ease of use.

---

### Unit Testing (UT)
Tests individual functions or methods in isolation to ensure they perform correctly.

---

### Visual Testing (VT)
Confirms correct UI appearance, layout, and design elements across devices and screens.

---

### VT1 - Platform (VT1)
Dedicated to platform-wide UI integrity and consistency validation.
