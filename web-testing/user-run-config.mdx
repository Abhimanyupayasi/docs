# ⚙️ QE User Config in NextGen QE

The **QE User Config** section in **NextGen QE** allows you to define essential configurations that control how your tests are executed and managed.  
It includes two key parts:
1. **Web Run Config** – defines how tests run across browsers and environments.  
2. **User Variables** – defines reusable data and dynamic values for your tests.

## 🌐 1. Web Run Config

# ⚙️ Web Run Config in NextGen QE

You can create **Web Runtime Configurations** to define how your web tests should be executed.  
This includes settings such as:
- Browser type and version  
- Operating system and resolution  
- Execution mode (Headful / Headless)  
- Environment (Local / Remote)  
- Reporting and logging preferences

### 🧩 Configuration Fields

| Field | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **OS Name *** | Operating System (e.g., Linux, Windows) |
| **OS Version *** | Version of the operating system (e.g., 22.05) |
| **Browser Name *** | Browser to use (e.g., Chrome, Edge) |
| **Browser Version *** | Browser version (e.g., 116) |
| **Screen Resolution** | Resolution for test execution screen |
| **Execution Mode** | Choose between *Headful* or *Headless* |
| **Execution Method** | Run tests in *Series* or *Parallel* |
| **Execution Environment** | Define as *Remote* or *Local* |
| **Report Screenshot** | Choose *Yes* or *No* for screenshot capture |
| **Auto Defect Log** | Automatically log defects (*Yes* / *No*) |

> 💡 **Tip:** Use headless mode for faster executions in CI pipelines.

## 🧮 2. User Variable Management

# 🧩 User Variable Management in NextGen QE

**User Variables** in **NextGen QE** allow you to define **global or user-specific variables** that can be reused across multiple test cases.  
This ensures consistency, flexibility, and ease of maintenance in your test data.

### 📘 What User Variables Can Store
- Session details (like **user cookies**)  
- Environment URLs  
- Authentication tokens  
- Any dynamic or reusable field values needed in test data  

These variables can be dynamically **referenced in Test Data** or **passed during test execution**.  

> 🔁 Example: Store multiple web cookies in a variable and reuse them across different test steps or modules without redefining them.

## 🔄 Why QE User Config Matters

By defining **Web Run Config** and **User Variables**, you ensure that your test execution:
- Is consistent across environments  
- Uses standardized data  
- Is easily maintainable for all team members
