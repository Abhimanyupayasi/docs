# Cross-Browser Testing in NextGen QE

Cross-Browser Testing ensures your web applications behave consistently across different browsers, versions, and platforms.  
It’s a crucial part of ensuring accessibility, stability, and performance for all users — regardless of how they access your application.

## 🧩 What is Cross-Browser Testing?

**Cross-Browser Testing** is the process of validating your web application’s functionality and UI across multiple browsers such as **Chrome**, **Firefox**, **Edge**, and **Safari**.  

It helps identify inconsistencies in:
- Layout rendering  
- Element behavior  
- JavaScript execution  
- Performance metrics  

This ensures every end user experiences the same functionality — no matter their browser or operating system.

## ⚙️ How NextGen QE Helps in Cross-Browser Testing

**NextGen QE** simplifies Cross-Browser Testing with an **AI-driven automation framework** that supports multi-browser execution through configuration-based setup.  

It enables:
- Browser-specific test execution without rewriting scripts  
- Centralized configuration for multiple browsers  
- Seamless integration with CI/CD pipelines for distributed testing  

To configure your preferred browser setup, refer to:  
👉 [Web Run Configuration](/web-testing/user-run-config#⚙%EF%B8%8F-web-run-config-in-nextgen-qe)

## 🚀 Cross-Browser Testing Capabilities in NextGen QE

1. **Multi-Browser Execution** — Run tests simultaneously across Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari.  
2. **Centralized Run Configurations** — Define browsers, environments, and execution parameters in one place.  
3. **Self-Healing Scripts** — Automatically adapt locators to browser-specific DOM differences.  
4. **Parallel Execution** — Reduce execution time by running test suites across browsers in parallel.  
5. **Smart Reporting** — View browser-wise test results and visual comparisons in real-time.
