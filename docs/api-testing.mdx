# API Testing in NextGen QE

API Testing focuses on validating the business logic, performance, and reliability of application interfaces that connect different systems.  
With **NextGen QE**, you can design, execute, and automate API tests using a **low-code**, **AI-driven** approach — ensuring backend systems are thoroughly validated before deployment.

## What is API Testing?

API Testing verifies whether an application’s **backend services and endpoints** function correctly and return expected responses under various conditions.  
It primarily focuses on **data exchange**, **response structure**, **status codes**, and **security validations** rather than UI-level testing.

Key objectives of API testing:
- Validate request and response payloads  
- Ensure data integrity and schema consistency  
- Test authentication and authorization mechanisms  
- Measure API response time and performance under load  
- Verify error handling and edge case behavior

## How NextGen QE Helps in API Testing

**NextGen QE** empowers teams to build and execute complex API automation workflows effortlessly through its **low-code orchestration** and **AI capabilities**.  
It supports **REST**, **SOAP**, and **GraphQL** APIs, allowing you to test any backend system efficiently.

Core advantages include:
- **Unified API Automation:** Create, manage, and run API tests alongside web and mobile test cases in a single platform.  
- **No-Code Test Authoring:** Define endpoints, methods, headers, and payloads with an intuitive form-based interface.  
- **Dynamic Data Handling:** Use variables, parameterization, and test data injection for dynamic API requests.  
- **Validation Rules:** Auto-generate or define assertions for status codes, response time, and payload content.  
- **Integration Testing:** Combine multiple API calls to test end-to-end workflows across systems.  
- **Continuous Testing:** Integrate API tests with CI/CD pipelines for automated validation during deployments.
