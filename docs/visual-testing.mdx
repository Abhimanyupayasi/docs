# Visual Testing in NextGen QE

Visual Testing ensures that your application's **user interface (UI)** appears correctly across browsers, devices, and screen resolutions.  
It detects unintended changes in layout, style, color, or element alignment that may occur after new code deployments or UI updates.

NextGen QE simplifies this process through **AI-based visual comparison** and **automated screenshot analysis**, ensuring every build maintains a consistent and error-free interface.

## What is Visual Testing?

**Visual Testing** focuses on verifying the *appearance* of web applications rather than their functional behavior.  
It compares baseline screenshots against newly captured versions to identify visual differences such as:

- Misaligned or hidden UI components  
- Broken layouts and overlapping text  
- Incorrect color, font, or spacing  
- Missing images or visual elements  

Visual testing complements traditional automation by validating what users *see*, ensuring both function and form are preserved.

## How NextGen QE Helps in Visual Testing

**NextGen QE** automates the entire visual validation cycle â€” from capturing baselines to analyzing visual differences using AI-driven precision.  

### Key Benefits:
- **Automated Baseline Capture:** Capture reference images during the first successful execution.  
- **AI-Powered Comparison:** Detect even subtle UI changes while ignoring acceptable differences (like dynamic timestamps).  
- **Cross-Browser Validation:** Validate UI consistency across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.  
- **Change Reporting:** Highlight mismatched pixels or regions with detailed visual diff reports.  
- **Seamless Integration:** Combine visual testing with your functional and regression suites.
