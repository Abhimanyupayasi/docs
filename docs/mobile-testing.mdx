## What is Mobile Testing?

Mobile Testing is the process of validating mobile applications for functionality, usability, performance, and compatibility.  
It involves executing test cases on real devices or emulators to ensure that the app behaves as expected under different network conditions, device configurations, and OS versions.

Key areas of mobile testing include:
- Functional validation of app features  
- UI and UX consistency across screen sizes  
- Performance and memory optimization  
- Validation on real and virtual devices  
- Network stability and offline behavior testing
